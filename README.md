### Tech

AndroidRoomApp uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Kotlin] - Native Android programming language more readable and instead of Java
* [Room] - Android local database library includes SQLite
* [RecyclerView] - To show list datas on UI, has better performance according to ListView
* [ViewModel] - The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
* [LiveData] - LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
* [Kotlin Coroutines] - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* [Preferences DataStore] - A data store interface to be implemented and provided to the Preferences framework. This can be used to replace the default SharedPreferences, if needed.
